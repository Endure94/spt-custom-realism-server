This repository exists to track changes to the Realism Mod for SPT by Fontaine as they are made to our community FIKA server. 

Link to Realism Mod: (https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/606-spt-realism-mod/#versions)

The intention behind these changes is to align EFT game mechanics with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s mechanics, while balancing gameplay enjoyment with realistic interpretations.

If you wish to play on our community server, join the FIKA Project Discord and look for messages from Oz advertising the server there. Discord links will not be provided here as they are prone to becoming outdated.

If you wish to make changes to Oz's community SPT server's implementation of the Realism Mod, you must first be a member of the server. Then, you must contact Oz for permission and to go over your ideas which will be scrutinized on subjects such as balancing, how you plan to implement the changes, and what the ultimate issue is that the changes are intended to address. From there you will need to pull down this repository, create your own branch with a title befitting the changes, and when you're finished making your changes, submit a pull request to merge your changes with the main branch.

If you simply wish to utilize our flavor of the Realism Mod, unaffiliated to our server, then forking this repo would be best..
